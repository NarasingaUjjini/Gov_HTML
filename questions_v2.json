The free-response section ofthe exam comprises 50 percent ofthe composite score. Each ofthe four questions has multiple components that, combined, require subject competence across a range of material and various levels ofsophistication. The questions are designed so that most students can answer part ofeach question, but only the most advanced and prepared students will receive a perfect score. Students who achieve the best scores have a broad command of the subject matter, the ability to engage in higher-order thinking, and the capacity to integrate across content areas. These free-response questions require familiarity with key terms and important concepts; command ofbasic facts; understanding ofsignificant theories; and the ability to think in causal or explanatory terms, combine theories and facts, reason through material that may be less familiar, integrate across content areas, and interpret basic forms of data presentation. Successful students answer the question asked and offer full explanations when requested. The questions use terminology that all successful students should know, but it is also true that not all text­ books and instructors use the same terms. Students who score well know the basic vocabulary of American politics, including synonyms for the same concept. The question-specific comments that follow illustrate these points. Scoring Guidelines, Sample Student Responses, and Commentary The answers presented on the following pages are actual student responses to the free-response questions on the 2009 AP United States Government and Politics Exam. The students gave permission to have their work reproduced at the time they took the exam. These responses were read and scored by the Table Leaders and Readers assigned to each particular question during the AP Reading in June 2009. The actual scores that these student responses earned, as well as a brief explanation ofwhy, are indicated. ' ..' .. \" \". :.\\ 37 Question 1-0verview The intent ofthis question was to examine students' knowledge of how the framers sought to deal with the power of factions-both majority and minority-in government and of how two ofthree specific twentieth-century developments have made the United States a more democratic system. The questions asked students: (1) to identify the part of the national government that was originally most closely tied to citizens and explain how that tie was accomplished; (2) to explain two ways the U.S. Constitution limited majority rule; and (3) to explain how democratization in the United States has been promoted by two ofthree developments-primary elections, the Seventeenth Amendment, or the expansion of suffrage. This question required students to understand how philosophies ofgovernment are implemented through institutional arrangements (mechanisms ofpopular control of government), how these arrangements can be manipulated to make government more or less responsive to the people, and how the United States has become more democratic across its history. The mean score was 2.83 out ofa possible 6 points. In answering part (a), many students were able to identify the House of Representatives (or, more generally, Congress) as the institution closest to the people, but they often were not able to explain why it is. Many knew that direct elections distinguished the House from other offices in the original Constitution. In part (b) students were less successful in explaining how the framers limited majority rule; they frequently wrote generally about separation ofpowers or checks and balances but didn't tie them to limited majority rule. In part (c) students had some success in explaining how the developments pushed the United States toward a more democratic system. Overwhelmingly, students avoided attempting to explain how the Seventeenth Amendment prompted this move, opting instead to attempt to explain the impact of primary elections and the expansion ofsuffrage. Scoring Guidelines for Question 1 6 points Part (a): 2 points One point is earned for identifying the House of Representatives or Congress. One point is earned for an explanation of how the House or Congress is most closely tied to citizens. Acceptable explanations are: • Members of the House are more directly elected than the president and were originally more directly elected than members ofthe Senate. • The shorter term length (or frequent elections) ties them to the people. • Members must live in the state they represent. • House members represent relatively small districts. Part (b): 2 points One point is earned for each oftwo explanations. Each explanation must show how a constitutional provision or principle limits majority rule. Any ofthe following can be used as a reference point in the explanation of how majority rule is limited (this is not an exhaustive list): Provisions that limit how the majority can have an impact on government Provisions that limit the power of government • Electoral college • U.S. senators originally selected by state legislatures • Longer terms ofsenators • Independent judiciary • Life tenure for U.S. Supreme Court justices • Appointment process • Representative form ofgovernment • Bill of Rights • Expressed powers • Specific prohibitions (e.g., ex postfacto laws, bills of attainder) • Separation ofpowers • Checks and balances • Federalism • Bicameralism . ..,;>ff 38 Scoring Guidelines for Question 1 (continued) Part (c): 2 points One point is earned for each oftwo explanations. Each explanation must state how the development cited moved the process from a less democratic system to a more democratic system in the twentieth century. Acceptable explanations must indicate how the United States became more democratic through: • Primary elections-voters gained more control over the nomination process/control taken away from political parties. • Seventeenth Amendment-mandated direct election of U.S. senators. • Expansion ofsuffrage-led to a more representative set ofvoters/more eligible voters. A score ofzero (0) is assigned to an answer that is attempted but that earns no points. A score ofdash (-) is assigned to a blank or off-task answer. 39 Sample Student Responses for Question 1 Student Response 1 (Score: 6) ft'?y,HC awl ckdss nwl &JM1!:.J' s 1k fk1luJ. $E,.k,s f.o ~ (L!\"1S Je.s,rrJ /0 be r '\" IQrfibl/g +Jc<+ 1bMk dwsoeral: (I, fJSp,,eJs ./0 h lYfr:.blrr I '$1 vol tR, of Jtw w (' aiR Wae.
