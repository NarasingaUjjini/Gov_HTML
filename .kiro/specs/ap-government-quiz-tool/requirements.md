# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive AP United States Government studying tool that provides students with multiple ways to practice and assess their knowledge. The tool includes three distinct study modes: unit-specific quizzes, timed practice tests, and unlimited study mode. The interface will be built using HTML/CSS for easy website integration and will feature a clean, intuitive design similar to hamstudy.org with progress tracking and unit-based organization.
